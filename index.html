          <p>  Welcome to my page. <br>
          My research explores how decentralized groups in conflict and post-conflict regions navigate collective action without central authority. My current focus is in the Southeast Asia, especially Myanmar.
              My driving question is how decentralized collective action maintains the agency of actors, motivating them to take on risks in pursuit of <i>public goods</i>, despite there being no centralized mechanism to curtail free-riding.
