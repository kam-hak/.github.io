          <p>  Welcome to my page.</p>
          <p>  I study decentralized collective action and governance in conflict and post-conflict settings. <br>
               My current focus is in the Southeast Asia, especially Myanmar. <br>
              My driving question is how decentralized collective action maintains the agency of actors, allowing them to take on incredible risks despite there being no centralized mechanism to curtail free-riding. <br>
              I study the institutional and normative devices which allow dispersed groups to coordinate governance and collective action despite personal costs.
