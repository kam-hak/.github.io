          <p>  Welcome to my page. My research explores how decentralized groups in conflict and post-conflict regions navigate collective action without central authority. My current focus is in the Southeast Asia, especially Myanmar. <br>
              My driving question is how decentralized collective action maintains the agency of actors, motivating them to take on incredible risks in pursuit of <i>public goods</i>, despite there being no centralized mechanism to curtail free-riding.<br>
              Through qualitative cases and experimental methods, I examine how groups construct institutional and normative devices to overcome these challenges.
