          <p>  Welcome to my page. <br>
          My research explores how decentralized groups in conflict and post-conflict regions navigate collective action without a central authority. My current work focuses on the Southeast Asia, especially post-coup Myanmar.<br>
          I see collective action as a driver of change within and between groups. I ask how decentralized actors coordinate across scales, take risks for public goods, and constrain free-riding â€” and how these efforts transform inter-group relations. <br>
          I use qualitative and experimental methods to understand how diverse groups overcome these challenges during conflict.
