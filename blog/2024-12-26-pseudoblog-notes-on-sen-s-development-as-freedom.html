Notes on Sen’s Development as Freedom</h1>
<h2 id="research-theory">Research / Theory</h2>

id="reflections-on-freedom-as-development-sen1999development">Reflections
on Freedom as Development <span class="citation"
data-cites="sen1999development">(<strong>sen1999development?</strong>)</span></h3>
<h4
id="freedom-in-development-is-both-constitutive-and-instrumental">Freedom
in development is both constitutive and instrumental</h4>
<ul>
<li>Freedom <em>is</em> the goal of development (i.e. constitutive of
development), and it also begets more freedom, making it
<em>instrumental</em> for achieving development.</li>
<li>Modern, though not traditional, economics focuses primarily on
instrumental, rather than constitutive.</li>
<li><strong>Over-simplification: growth must precede social
services</strong>: Sen argues that many social services are <em>labor
intensive</em>, meaning they can be relatively cheaply provided prior to
(or at early stages of) GNP growth.</li>
<li>Social services, especially education, may also provide a
<em>foundation and launchpad</em> for rapid growth. This may explain the
‘east asian miracle’, where Japan and China had long invested in
education <em>prior</em> to market-based growth. Because of widespread
(noneconomic) capabilities, their economic growth was explosive by
historical standards.
<ul>
<li>Empirically, he points to studies which indicate that it is not GNP
<em>per se</em> that provides important social benefits, but rather the
<em>investment</em> of that growth into social protection and
healthcare. In cross-country regression, the relationship between GNP
and life expectancy largely disappeared once investment in social
services was controlled for. Adding GNP atop explained very
<em>additional</em>.</li>
<li>Gabon is the unfortunate example with relatively high GNP (to Kerala
for instance). This may also be related to the resources curse.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Political rights are a luxury</strong>: He points to the
powerful statistic that a democracy, no matter how poor, has never
experienced a famine. This is because famine are relatively cheap to
avoid if a government is motivated.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="does-sen-take-a-strong-positive-liberty-stance">Does Sen Take a
Strong Positive Liberty Stance?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sen takes a sharp stand against appeals to traditional norms if they
limit the ability for people to participate. That is, any traditional
value which limits the enabling factors for people to take political
action – such as education, free communication/speech, or political
voice – cannot be defended via appeal to freedom.</li>
<li>That is, you cannot make the circular argument that people are free
to select unfreedom for others, at least not <em>structurally</em>. Of
course, any individual can chose to bar <em>themselves</em> from these
freedoms.
<ul>
<li>This is somewhat related to <a
href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/#PosLibConNeu">John
Christman</a>‘s argument that positive freedom requires people are able
to select their desires via rationality, <em>rather than</em> social
pressure or indoctrination. <strong>More explicitly</strong>: Sen would
say that, if a group (e.g. women) were denied education or indoctrinated
to not desire some rights, they cannot truly ’freely’ select this
desire.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="information-basis-and-conceptions-of-justice">Information basis,
and conceptions of justice</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sen opens with a wonderful mini-puzzle. If an employer can only
employ one person, all poor. Who should she employ:
<ul>
<li>The absolute poorest (poorest in terms of money)
<ul>
<li>Reducing absolute poorest defined as income</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The one who is experiencing most <em>disutility</em> (poorest in
terms of utility)
<ul>
<li>Reducing absolute poorest defined by utility</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The one who would gain the most marginal utility (highest utility
value in return for work)
<ul>
<li>Maximizing utility (there is another version of this where it solves
a income trap and maximizes total money)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4
id="heterogeneity-in-capability-to-convert-commodities-into-utility">Heterogeneity
in capability to ‘convert’ commodities into utility</h4>
<p>Money has different impacts depending on individual characteristics:
1. <strong>Personal heterogeneities</strong>: physical, mental, etc. 2.
<strong>Environmental</strong>: climate, including temperature, weather,
disease, and access to land types. 3. <strong>Social climate</strong>:
culture, social services, social networks (capital), law/order,
institutions, and religion. 4. <strong>Relational perspectives,
inter-social</strong>: Variation on relative status — e.g., what one
needs to “appear in public without shame” (pp. 72). 5.
<strong>Distribution intra-family</strong>: Rules and norms for
distribution of goods within the family.</p>
<h4 id="sen-vs.-rawls-on-primary-goods">Sen vs. Rawls on Primary
Goods</h4>
<ul>
<li>Rawls has a concept of <strong>primary goods</strong>, which are
distinguishable from income:
<ul>
<li><strong>Rights, liberties, opportunities, income/wealth, and social
bases for self-respect.</strong>
<ul>
<li>These primary goods are related to individuals’ ability to pursue
their <strong>conception of the good.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Having the same basket of primary goods</strong> is the
basis of justice, as individuals take responsibility for their own
preferences.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sen moderately disagrees. He notes that the same basket of goods
(whether primary or not) does not contain the <em>capabilities</em> to
convert these into utility (see 98 Timestamps/Daily
notes/2024/12-December/22-Sunday#Heterogeneity in capability to
‘convert’ commodities into utility)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sen-democracy">Sen &amp; Democracy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Common argument: the poor want economic development
<strong>before</strong> democracy, and empirically, these two as in
tension (<strong>Lee Kuan Yew thesis</strong>).
<ul>
<li><strong>Sen argues these premises are wrong</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Poor people <strong>do want democracy</strong>. Example: Indira
Gandhi overwhelmingly lost an election on this point.</li>
<li>Statistically, no evidence shows authoritarianism
<strong>out-develops democracies</strong> (Acemoglu et al. argue the
opposite).</li>
<li>Sen rejects the claim that democracy is a “Western” value.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="democracy-has-three-roles-in-developement">Democracy has three
roles in developement</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Democracy has 3 roles in development</strong>:
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Direct (constitutive)</strong> role: Democracy is an
<strong>end</strong> of development.</li>
<li><strong>Instrumental</strong> role: Democracy is a
<strong>means</strong> of development.</li>
<li><strong>Constructive</strong> role: Democracy <strong>constructs the
conceptual needs and wants</strong> that people pursue.<br />
This is a <strong>process role that defines the ends</strong>.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="constructive-role">Constructive Role</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debate and discussion</strong> shape what people have a
reason to want.</li>
<li>Groups cannot collectively decide what they want <strong>without
deliberation</strong>.</li>
<li>Choices must be <strong>informed and reflected</strong> through:
<ul>
<li>Debate, discussion, criticism, and dissent.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Preferences depend on these processes.</li>
<li>Many preferences are integral to development: Example: fertility
rates.</li>
<li>Discussion induces a <strong>social response</strong> to wants,
values, or needs: Example: universal education or food access.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="democracy-and-its-dependence-on-exercise">Democracy and its
dependence on ‘exercise’</h4>
<ul>
<li>A powerful point made by Sen is that democracy’s capability
potential is not self-actualizing. It requires people to deploy that
freedom in pursuit of greater. This is in comparison to a vaccine, in
which the cause is mechanically actualized by providing the formula (and
meeting certain conditions, e.g. cold chain).</li>
<li>Democracy (and freedoms generally) cannot guarantee any specific
outcome but, it has the most <em>potential</em> for improving
capabilities.
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoids famines</strong> (even if not malnutrition).</li>
<li>Undervotes exist even in mature democracies (e.g., the U.S.).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Democracy does not work <strong>mechanically</strong> as a universal
remedy.</li>
<li>Must be <strong>positively guarded</strong>:
<ul>
<li>“This is a basic feature of freedoms generally—much depends on how
they are exercised.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Opposition political groups</strong> may greatly influence
governance without gaining power:
<ul>
<li>By inducing the leading party to compete in providing services.</li>
<li>This also operates in <strong>non-democratic contexts</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3
id="theory-of-animosity-towards-minority-ethnics-courtin-et-al.-2023">Theory
of animosity towards minority ethnics (Courtin et al. 2023)</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="citation"
data-cites="Courtin_2023_PovertyPrejudiceGenocide">Courtin, Nellis, and
Weaver (2023)</span> use an original dataset from Myanmar 2017 (shortly
before the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya) to identify the drivers of
genocide by connecting this to later administrative and event data.</li>
<li>They find poverty is closely related to anti-Muslim attitudes, and
that this is most associated with scapegoating, rather than resources
competition.
<ul>
<li>Control for education levels of individual and township level
characteristics.</li>
<li>Difference between wealthiest and poorest anti-Muslim sentiment is
14.5 to 24.6 percentage point, for ‘wholly intolerant’ on a question
battery.</li>
<li>Anti-Muslim sentiment does not increase for more mixed communities,
going against resource competition.</li>
</ul></li>
