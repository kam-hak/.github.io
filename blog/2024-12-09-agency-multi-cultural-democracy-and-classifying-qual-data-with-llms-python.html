Majoritarianism without majorities <span class="citation"
data-cites="Chandra_2024_FutureMultiracialDemocracy">(Chandra
2024)</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main Argument</strong>: Chandra argues in JoD 2024 issue
that viewing democracy as majoritarian rule incentivizes the
conglomeration of minorities into larger groupings to reach a majority –
this initially causes ‘majoritarian nationalists’ which is a grouping of
minorities which claim a common ethnicity. Fundamentally, she argues
that democracy should frame itself as <em>minority rule</em>.
<ul>
<li><strong>Majorities(arians) with a minority complex</strong> ‚Äì
These ‘majoritarians’ fear being replaced by ethnic change.
Additionally, ethnic identity (e.g. Italians in the US were once seen as
non-protestant minorities, who a protestant majority feared and
combatted politically). Demographic threat inflames ethnic
majoritarianism (i.e. ethnical nationally) and democratic backsliding.
This backsliding is especially clear using maximalist definitions of
democracy, as minority rights.</li>
<li><strong>Constructed majorities</strong> – these majorities are often
(always?) an agglomeration of minority groups which claim a common
supra-ethnicity or race. For example, ‘white’ in the case of America
typically includes Italians, despite Catholics/Italians being seen as
separate previously.</li>
<li><strong>Censuses drive identity formation, not education
(alone)</strong> – groups are inherently multidimensional and poorly
defined. They are also not <em>legible</em> to their members
intrinsically. <em>Censuses</em> are what drive the conglomeration of
minority groups into a majority, and create this ‘majority with a
minority complex’ dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Democracy drives the <em>political</em> construction of
majorities</strong>: Without democracy, being part of a majority has
much less utility. For much of human history, people attempted
<em>not</em> to be associated with the (rude and unwashed) masses.
Instead, they sought whatever identity lead to benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Immigrant and natives</strong> – become a salient dividing
line in politics, where different immigrants are viewed as political
threats or opportunities depending on the policy positions and expected
voting disposition of the immigrants (among other things, such as
economic effects and labor competition; perceived cultural fit,
etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Democracy and ethnocracy go together</strong>: Because
democracy drives the formation of (ethnic) ‘majorities’ which can
compete politically, thus driving a majoritarian outlook. This is
perhaps the boldest claim.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing majorities, through violent/othering
rhetoric</strong> Because majoritarianism is difficult, it relies on
violence and ‘othering’ outsiders to establish. This is akin to
promoting nationalism through <em>negative national sentiment</em> (see
<span class="citation"
data-cites="Alesina_2020_NationbuildingNationalismWars">Alesina, Reich,
and Riboni (2020)</span>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Chandra’ solution – Redefine Democracy as Minority
Protecting</strong>: To reduce the fear of political loss (and therefore
the driver of majorities(ians) with a minority complex), we need focus
democracies on strengthening minority protection and <em>accept</em>
that majorities are primarily manufactured for and by <em>political
means</em> by multiple minority groups. And interpreted through censuses
(e.g. category of ‘white’ on the US census). Similarly, BJP in India
draws supporters from a highly diverse set of hindus without India.</li>

<h4 id="who-decides-who-is-democratic-przeworski_2024_whodecideswhat">2.
Who decides who is Democratic <span class="citation"
data-cites="Przeworski_2024_WhoDecidesWhat">(Przeworski
2024)</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>This short (11pg!) paper is full of distilled ideas on defining
conceptions of democracy, and how ‘slippery’ the term is to
operationalize. The heart of the essay is that minimal, ‘electoralism’
definitions of democracy, actually rely on a richer set of assumptions
(inadvertently maximalist). Yet, recognizing this, and moving towards a
maximalist approach presents a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_stopping">stopping
problem</a>, where ‘true’ democracy becomes almost impossible to reach.
<ul>
<li><strong>Democracy as a Process or Embodiment of Values</strong>: The
two ‘poles’ of democratic minimalism (thin) vs. democratic maximalism
(thick) are determined by whether democracy is a process for
<em>resolving</em> political conflicts, or requires <em>embodying</em>
certain values (e.g. minority protection, freedoms, etc.).
<ul>
<li>A minimal (thin) definition of democracy requires only that citizens
decide by who and how they will be governed. Any answer they provide is
inherently democratic. Whether something is democratic is Democracy as a
Process or Embodiment of Values|process oriented, rather than the
embodiment of values.</li>
<li>Naturally, maximal (thick) definitions of democracy are inverse.
However, Przeworski argues that maximalist definitions of democracy are
prompted by a clear weakness of minimal democracy: a <em>process</em>
has many requirements, such as the free flow of information, adequate
information, fair electoral and political competition, and lack of
duress. However, attempting to define democracy in maximalist terms also
present a stopping problem. You can always justify adding more
requirements to democracy (media freedom, freedom of movement, electoral
safeguards). However,</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Everyone claims democracy</strong>: Everyone (including
non-democrats) claim to be democratic. No one claims to be a fascist,
even if they agree with some of its <em>content</em>. And communism is
often defended on <em>democratic</em> grounds (e.g. Xi Jingping’ ‘<a
href="http://en.moj.gov.cn/2024-03/05/c_967573.htm">whole process
people’s democracy</a>’).</li>
<li><strong>More subtly, anti-liberal groups claim minimal
democracy</strong>: many newer right-wing parties (which are viewed as
anti-democracy from a maximalist vantage) have generally shied away from
impinging on electoral process. Rather, they have implemented laws which
are <em>anti-pluralist</em>, such as France severely restricting the
rights of noncitizens in France. yet, these laws are widely supported
(pg 5). Are these undemocratic or simply xenophobic?
<ul>
<li>A thornier point is whether democracy is invested in the people of
today, or in the values embedded in an institution. For instance, the
Indian constitution enshrines <em>equality</em> of all religions.
However, the majority of people <em>today</em> may welcome
discrimination. Are judges acting undemocratically to strike down laws
with majority support? The requirement for super-majorities to change
constitutions is, arguably, quite undemocratic, especially if the
requirement is exorbitant (imagine a 95% requirement to purge a
constitutional amendment which benefited 10% of the population).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Populism is dissatisfaction with representative
institutions</strong>: Populism arises when people feel poorly
represented. Populism has two forms, participatory populism and
delegative populism. Participatory is good-to-benign, but ‚âàineffective
(little evidence given). While delegative populism is a ‘by any means
necessary’ delegation, which is antithetical to the norms and
institutional safeguards protecting maximalist democracy, or ‘liberal
democracy’, functioning.
<ul>
<li><strong>Participatory populism</strong> is ensuring the ‘voice of
the people’ is incorporated into political processes <em>beyond</em>
elections. For instance, through shorter terms, participatory
institutions at the local level, etc. Here, the idea is to <em>increase
the institutional surface area</em> between the people and institutions
(e.g. participatory budgeting in Brazil).</li>
<li><strong>Delegative populism</strong> is to ensure that the ‘will of
the people’ is enacted <em>no matter what</em>, even if it means
breaking norms or institutional safeguards. For instance, packing the
courts, breaking political norms (e.g. independence of the fed / FBI),
or skirting constitutionally enshrined <em>values</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Delegative populism</strong> will often be tasked <em>by a
majority</em> with destroying the foundations of democracy itself (at
least liberal, though not limited to). However, if they avoid destroying
<em>democratic</em> institutions, and instead focus on institutions
which stymie the will of the public, they are not inherently illiberal
(e.g. a reformer could fix corruption).</li>
<li><strong>Delegative (illiberal) populism is driven by
‘magicians’</strong>: These are individuals claiming to be saviors
(e.g. I alone…). They promise strength against the systems people have
grown to distrust.
<ul>
<li><em>The emergence of political magicians is also not antidemocratic.
It just shows that when people become fed up with the established
alternatives, they are willing to take the risk of embracing untried
solutions.</em> (pg 11)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Przeworksi goes back to defending elections themselves.
<ul>
<li><strong>Precaution</strong>: Elections, beyond any specific policy,
allow for removal of governments at a later date. Supporters should not
trade elections for even the best (?) temporary policy.</li>
<li><strong>Pacification</strong>: if electoral conflict exists, it
obviates much of the the need for arms. Other systems can solve
political problems, but elections are the only which are available to
<em>all</em> citizens.
<ul>
<li>*In Norberto Bobbio’s words, &gt; “What is democracy other than a
set of rules . . . for the solution of conflicts without
bloodshed?”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Minimalism unites, maximalism divides</strong>: It is easy
to be <em>against</em> backsliding, but very hard to coalesce around a
single policy alternative. This is a fundamental asymmetry which,
ironically, Przeworski claims can only be solved through elections
(minimalist?).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="development-as-freedom">Development as Freedom (WIP)</h3>
<ul>
<li>I’m returning to Sen’s ‘development as freedom’ to specifically
consider his treatment of agency. An important argument from Elizabeth
Wood’s account of insurgency in El Salvador is that their <em>experience
of collective action</em> changed the population’s self-conception,
raising the <em>sense of agency</em>, as well as their
<em>self-conception</em>. Coming in, I am curious about multiple things:
<ol type="1">
<li>Are capabilities and agency interchangeable?</li>
<li>Is the subjective notion of self-efficacy (e.g. including socialized
notions, such as the Horatio Alger myth) a moderator for capabilities?
<ul>
<li>I may be objectively capable, but systematically do not utilize the
capability if I <em>view myself</em> as incapable.</li>
<li>Action has three categories of consequence related to capabilities,
changes to internal capacity, changes to external capacities, and
utility payoffs:
<ul>
<li><strong>Internal capacity</strong>: is a variety of internal
processes such as skill, tacit/explicit knowledge, and self-conception
as a result of action. This can be positive (higher self-efficacy) or
lower (discouragement / incorrect knowledge).</li>
<li><strong>External capacity</strong>: is the change in externally
mediated capacities as a result of pay-off</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="python-to-ipynb">Python to ipynb</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connecting py to ipynb run on the cloud</strong>
<ul>
<li>In using kaggle problems to learn about machine learning, I wanted
to connect my local nvim environment to Kaggle’s notebook (a slighty
modified ipynb) and cloud compute resource.</li>
<li>The easiest solution was to use <strong>jupytext</strong> to connect
a py and ipynb of the notebook, which mirror the ipynb on Kaggle. I then
used a makefile to automate the 3 main steps: 1) sync my py to my local
ipynb, 2) to sync this with Kaggle via their API, and 3) to update this
all to a git so the projects are saved.
<ul>
<li>Mirroring Kaggle’s cloud file structure is slightly complicated. I
used the following to adjust for our different environments, while
keeping everything else the same:</li>

Programming: Qual-to-Quant data Classifier, using Ollama</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prototyped a Qual-to-Quant data Classifier, using Ollama which
categorizes structured, qualitative text.
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a></strong> allows me
to run open-source LLM models locally. This is super useful for
prototyping, without the cost or hassle of calling enterprise models via
an API. I’m using a llama3.2, 3B parameter model which runs fairly
quickly on a m1 Mac.
<ul>
<li>Ollama has a <strong>python package</strong> which allows you to
modify its parameters in a structured fashion, especially for multiple
calls (rather than going through the terminal).</li>
<li>However, the ollama python package requires the ollama app to be
running on your machine locally, and also is only installable via pip
(the Conda version package seems no longer supported).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I generated a test dataset to categorize food to ethnic cuisines,
which worked well.</li>
<li>I also added a ‘clarification’ loop, where you can clarifying coding
that was incorrect (by providing additional rules or information.). This
worked well if I was extremely specific (e.g. Pad Thai is American), but
not if I attempted to introduce a logic (e.g. switch the categorization
for all Italian and Thai foods).</li>
<li><strong>Refinement / testing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Test this on social-science relevant dataset (ACLED MMR?)</li>
<li>Connect this to an enterprise model (Gemini - for the very long
context or Claude - most sophisticated text analysis?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Major next step</strong>: is to build a program which takes
<em>unstructured</em> qualitative data and breaks it down into logical
‘pieces’. I will likely start with plain text, then introduce extracting
plain text from a pdf.</li>

(2024)</span>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10109">Generative
Agent Simulations of 1,000 People</a>, claims that LLMs can be used to
fairly reliably approximate the distribution of a sample from true human
populations. They claim to correctly model minority groups, and,
surprisingly, to be able to replicate responses reliably over time (85%
as well as humans). A recurring tension with AI is whether they need to
be good, or simply better than human alternatives. Humans are
notoriously unreliable when answering questions over time (or driving),
so how much better, if at all, should we expect AI to be?</p>
