   </span>
   ‘s seminal ’Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development’
provides a
   <em>
    convincing
   </em>
   account for the emergence of both
autocratic and democratic governance, only relying on self-interested
actors. However, is it a
   <em>
    comprehensive
   </em>
   account? I believe that
it leaves out two key phenomena, rendering them either unexplained
(dynasties) or epiphenomena (nationalism). However, the ubiquity of both
suggests they are fundamental.
  </p>
  <p>
   In Olson’s account, raw
   <em>
    self
   </em>
   -interest drives the development
of governance from anarchy –&gt; autocracy –&gt; democracy under certain
circumstances (none of the steps are assured). The power of his
framework is its parsimony, and he acknowledges that it smooths over
many important factors. However, pure self-interest do not account for
two factors deeply embedded in the modern nation state: one, dynasties
and two, national identity / national
   <em>
    ism
   </em>
   .
  </p>
  <h4 id="extending-the-self-to-whom-by-what">
   Extending the self to whom?
By what?
  </h4>
  <p>
   Olson does not discuss nationalism
   <em>
    per se
   </em>
   , however he does
note that dynasties are a means for extending the ‘life’ of a monarch.
Unstated however is why the
   <em>
    self
   </em>
   is extended to children.
Assumedly, there is a ‘self-ish gene’
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Dawkins_1976_SelfishGene">
    (Dawkins 1976)
   </span>
   argument.
However, this is a substantial expansion of the ‘self’, one which
supports a quite broad account of kin-based altruism
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Kay_2020_EvolutionAltruismSerial Green_2024_EvolutionKinDiscrimination">
    (Kay,
Keller, and Lehmann 2020; Green et al. 2024)
   </span>
   , which may extend to
‘fictive kinship’
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Qirko_2011_FictiveKinshipInduced">
    (Qirko 2011)
   </span>
   . That
is, once one allows for the ‘self’ to be a manipulable
   <em>
    perception
   </em>
   of connectedness (no king could
   <em>
    actually
   </em>
   do
a DNA test historically), the ability to extend the human self becomes
quite broad.

  <h4 id="dynasties-kinship-and-inter-dependent-utility">
   Dynasties,
kinship and inter-dependent utility
  </h4>
  <p>
   If Olson’s account admits some degree of unselfish behavior (meaning
literally beyond the self) and towards a broader genetic group (kin), we
can ask what the mechanism is. The evolutionary biology literature
suggests that the
   <em>
    degree
   </em>
   of kin perception moderates the
extension of self-interest. That is, humans are altruistic because they
incorporate others utility functions into their own
   <em>
    as a function of
the their relatedness
   </em>
   . Hamilton’s rule from evolutionary biology
predicts altruistic behavior whenever the fitness ‘sacrifice’ increases
the fitness of another relative to their shared genetic heritage (
   <span class="math inline">
    \(rB &gt; C\)
   </span>
   , where
   <span class="math inline">
    \(r\)
   </span>
   is genetic similarity between actor and
recipient,
   <span class="math inline">
    \(B\)
   </span>
   is fitness benefit to
the recipient, and
   <span class="math inline">
    \(C\)
   </span>
   is fitness
cost to the actor. The basis of altruism in perceived kinship has been
durable and ‘serially re-discovered’ finding within evolutionary biology
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Kay_2020_EvolutionAltruismSerial">
    (Kay, Keller, and Lehmann
2020)
   </span>
   and it is apparent from even the lowest rungs
(non-thinking) of the tree of life
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Green_2024_EvolutionKinDiscrimination">
    (Green et al.
2024)

   .

  <h4 id="nationalism-as-an-extension-of-fictive-kin">
   Nationalism as an

  </h4>
  <p>
   If
   <em>
    perceived
   </em>
   shared kinship is the basis for dynastic
altruism, we can assume this applies to the population
   <em>
    also
   </em>
   . If
so, this is the most likely explanation for the rise of the
   <em>
    nation
state
   </em>
   . Nation-states ‘extend’ the kinship group to a wider
identity, in which utilities are inter-dependent. This notion is derived
from
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Anderson_1983_ImaginedCommunitiesReflectionsa">
    Anderson
(1983)
   </span>
   ‘s ’imagined communities’, in which the modern nation
imagines themselves to be part of a collective. Anderson points to
shared media and common movement through central institutions
(universities, governments) in state and regional capitals While not
explicitly kin, a nation state may be an alternate vehicle for
   <em>
    fictive kinship
   </em>
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Qirko_2011_FictiveKinshipInduced">

    Alesina, Reich,

   </span>
   argues that a
   <em>
    positive
   </em>
   nationalism is
used for just this purpose – to create a broad group in which people
will desire the provision of public, rather than selective, goods. This
allows for the efficient recruitment of soldiers. To the extent that the
nation is seen as an extension of the family, this perception would
increase the provision of public goods, as the population’s benefit can
be derived from both their own
   <em>
    and others
   </em>
   benefits within the
national community. This may be a virtuous cycle, as the
   <em>
    altruistic
   </em>
   provision and enjoyment of public goods across the
national population reinforces feelings of fictive kinship. A key
hypothesis I am interested to test is whether altruistic action
   <em>
    causes
   </em>
   perceptions of shared kinship (rather than the reverse,
kinship –&gt; altruism).
  </p>
  <h4 id="what-new-does-this-explain">
   What new does this explain?
  </h4>
  <p>
   Olson’s account explains democracy, but the ubiquity of both
dynasties and nationalism cannot be easily explained. The introduction
of perceived kinship as the
   <em>
    building block
   </em>
   of altruism allows
for an explanation, in which collective good provision is further
incentivized by the incorporation of kin (dynasty) or the nation
(ethnic-nationalism being more proximate to kinship than or
civic-nationalism, which may be more fictive kinship
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Qirko_2011_FictiveKinshipInduced">
    (Qirko
2011)
   </span>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   <em>
    P.S. Another unaddressed point, that seemed separate enough to
discuss elsewhere, is the creation of the idea of a divine ‘monarchy’.
The notion of a monarchy and legitimacy itself is an extra-rational
notion, which requires moral ideas (someone should rule for X or Y
reason). This speaks to
    <span class="citation" data-cites="Bowles_2016_MoralEconomyWhy">
     Bowles (2016)
    </span>
    ‘s argument
about morality being deeply intertwined in economics. If Olson’s account
was correct, populations should know that the state is a stationary
bandit, so there would be no need for monarchy to legitimate itself
morally (they could be worshipped without claiming the legitimacy of
that worship – in fact, many gods may be worshipped out of fear rather
than morality per se. The notion that capital-G God is ’good’ and
‘legitimate’ is, at least partially, a newer advancement, insofar as
there were multiple gods with different characteristics and
suitabilities in the past. So, while Socrates may as ‘what pleases the
gods’, it is not clear that any single one was ‘legitimate’ or a sole
‘ruler’… certainly, they were at least fallible.. )
