   Is the

   bomb?
  </h3>
  <p>
   There is significant discussion about a reverse population bomb,
where the world’s population (especially in richer countries) plummets.
East asian countries such as China (due to state imposition), Japan, and
S Korea are most often cited. Alice Evans asks why this is not a much
bigger deal in policy circles, and whether everyone, but especially
progressives, are massively
   <em>
    under-reacting
   </em>
   the possible
decline.
  </p>
  <p>
   Besides the demographic consequences, what does this mean for
   <em>
    regime types
   </em>
   ? Especially, if neoliberalism and democracy have
become intertwined (see
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Riedl_2025_NeoliberalismThirdWave">
    Riedl (2025)
   </span>
   ),
   <strong>
    will the reverse population bomb be a reverse democracy
bomb?

  <p>
   In short,
   <em>
    kind of (?)
   </em>
   . Using an extremely simple approach, I
simply look at the change in % of people living in Free, Partly Free,
and Not Free countries according to Freedom House. This incorporates
past regime type changes, but assumes that all countries are ‘locked in’
after 2024.
  </p>
  <p>
   Its certainly not a bomb, but a meaningful decline as a percentage of
population. This is almost entirely driven by rapid growth among ‘partly
free’ countries, modest growth among ‘not free’ countries, and slowing
reversing growth among democracies
  </p>
  <p>
   There is a decline in percentage of the population living in ‘Free’
countries (using Freedom House) (20.4% to 16.4%). Roughly 20% (-4pp).
Interestingly, this is almost entirely going to ‘Partly Free’ countries
going from 40.4 to 43.8% (+8.4% or +3.4pp). ‘Not Free’ rises only
slightly from 39.1% to 39.7%.

   <strong>
    Modernization theory’s caveat
   </strong>
   : Obviously,
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernization_theory">
    modernization
theory
   </a>
   would like a word with me. But, putting that aside, this
gives a (vague) sense of how population change will shift what regimes
humans live in. There is also increasing uncertainty about the
trajectory of global development’s beneficiaries in the coming decades
given widespread xenophobic immigration rhetoric, challenges to
export-led development, and AI’s unclear impacts on labor value – e.g.
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Acemoglu_2023_PowerProgressOur">
    Acemoglu and Johnson
(2023)
   </span>
   and
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Autor_2024_ApplyingAIRebuild">
    Autor (2024)
   </span>
   convincingly argue that AI could help or decimate the laboring class
depending on who designs its use.
  </p>
  <p>
   The past few years certainly give some credence to
   <span class="citation" data-cites="Arendt_1959_HumanCondition">
    Arendt
(1959)
   </span>
   ’s warning that human agency is not strictly bound by laws
or rationalist accounts of individual or state actions (and certainly
Trump tariff regime undercuts arguments notions presidents/individuals
can’t effect the economy or political trajectories unilaterally).

   Building the react tool
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    React is essentially just an abstraction of a webpage, where you can
interactively ‘update’ only portions of it based on functions and
classes
   </li>
   <li>
    This abstraction allowing the combining of html and javascript (JS)
using the javascript XML(jsx). This is not a true language, but is
compiled via Babel, turning it into true JS.
   </li>
   <li>
    In my react tool, I have a chart component (RegimePopulationChart).
This being a component makes it reusable and modular (can be called and
changed independently in code).
   </li>
   <li>
    React, unlike vanilla JS, also has ‘states’, meaning I can re-render
data and calculate it live. For instance, as a percentage or absolute
data. I do this ‘on click’ in the page.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="hosting-react-on-github">
   Hosting react on github
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Hosting react is a pain to figure out (at least at first).
   </li>
   <li>
    It needs to be compiled from jsx into JS, it requires having a
workflow which correctly shows the compiled version from a branch
(rather than the main github branch)
   </li>
   <li>
    <code>
     npm run deploy
    </code>
    creates the branch, in
    <code>
     ~/react_page/dist/
    </code>
   </li>
   <li>
    <code>
     /.github/workflows/
    </code>
    is where you place custom workflows
to understand how to properly parse the main vs. gh-pages branches.
   </li>
   <li>
    having npm installed by both
    <code>
     pip
    </code>
    and
    <code>
     brew
    </code>
    is also dangerous.
