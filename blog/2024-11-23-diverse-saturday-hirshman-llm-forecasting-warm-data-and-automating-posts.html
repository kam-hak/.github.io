Saturday: Hirshman, LLM forecasting, warm-data, and automating
posts</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hirshman’s Tunnel Effect</strong> - the idea that people are
ok with inequality if they believe they will eventually benefit Horatio
Alger Myth… however, if they don’t believe this, then they become very
upset.</li>
<li><strong>Hirshman’s Exit voice loyalty</strong> was mostly concerned
with firms. However, to our knowledge, it’s never been applied to the
concept of social movements and ‘voice’</li>
<li>The ‘image’ of a matrix with respect to a vector is basically just
them multiplied.</li>
<li>To ‘solve’ a systems of equations you need to multiply by the
inverse… I thinK?
<ul>
<li>A system of equations is essentially <span class="math inline">\(A*x=b\)</span>. To solve, you do <span class="math inline">\(x=A^-1*b\)</span>. The inverse is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{det(A)}*Adj(A)\)</span> (Adj is adjugate
matrix)</li>
<li>Only works if A is a square matrix, and the determinant of A must
not be 0.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Warm Data</strong>: This is akin to metadata for emergent
relationships within complex systems. Also akin to documentation for
complex, designed spaces. However, I haven’t seen any compelling case
studies of how this effects irl change.</li>
<li><strong>Medium Translation</strong>: Is using AI to translate the
SAME MESSAGE between mediums. At the limit, this is a huge translation,
but also smaller translations are possible…. (i.e. ton + audience)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2402.18563v1">Forecasting
with LLMs</a></strong>: A team at Berkeley is exploring using LLM agents
to make systematic forecasts. An extremely interesting paper on using
LLMs to forecase events used a RAG design to automatically search for
relevant information and produce forecasts. The models were almost as
good as the AGGREGATE of competitive forecasters, and beat it in some
cases.
<ul>
<li>It seems like it could use deterministic code as a ‘scratchpad’ for
predictions.</li>
<li>The RAG system allows it to get high quality data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Simon Willison uses github’s issues as a more narrative, second
brain for projects.
<ul>
<li>The ‘issues’ and project scaffolding tracks developments and allows
him to switch rapidly between tasks without long information loading
phases (as all the information and decisions are stored
chronologically).</li>
<li>Testing for myself with <a href="https://github.com/users/kam-hak/projects/2">KLH Website</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Setting up personal learning notes page/website</strong>
<ul>
<li>I’ve set up a blog page for my website (kamranhakiman.com/blog), and
improved the readability of the very simple website (e.g. limited the
width of text to wrap at 800px). I’m doing coding by hand for muscle
memory learning.</li>
<li>Working with Claude and ChatGPT, I was able to produce an automated
workflow which pulls from daily notes on my computer and automatically
adds both the correct link into my website.</li>
<li>The actual program is in python. However, I’m pulling in both html
and css.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Maths</strong>
<ul>
<li>Binomial theorem: <span class="math inline">\((a + b)^n =
\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\)</span>, note that <span class="math inline">\(\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\)</span> is the
binomial selection of n from k.</li>
<li>Arithmetic sums solves as: <span class="math inline">\(S_n =
\frac{n}{2}*(a+l)\)</span>, where a is first term, l is last term, and n
is the number of terms
<ul>
<li>Sigma notation: <span class="math inline">\(S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n}
\left( a_1 + (k-1)d \right)\)</span> – here d is the amount of
de/in-crementation</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Geometric sum solves as: <span class="math inline">\(S_n=a*\frac{1-(r)^n}{1-r}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the ratio of interest and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the first time
<ul>
<li>Sigma notation: <span class="math inline">\(S = \sum_{n=0}^{24} a
\cdot (r)^n\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Permutation vs. Combination</strong> notation. <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> are the events that we care about, and
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the total number of possible
events.
<ul>
<li>Permutations (order doesn’t matter) are just the factorial of the n!
/ (n-r)!: <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(_r P_n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(P(n,r)\)</span></li>
<li>Combinations (order DOES matter) are the factorial of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(_r C_n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(C(n,r)\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
