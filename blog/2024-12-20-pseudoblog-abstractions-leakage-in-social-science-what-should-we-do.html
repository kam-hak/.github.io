Abstraction Leakage is a Significant Problem in Social Science. What should we do?</h1>
<h2 id="research-theory">Research / Theory</h2>
<h3 id="social-science-abstractions-leak---what-should-we-do">Social
science abstractions ‘leak’ - what should we do?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Abstractions are vital, but like many living things, dangerous,
because <a
href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">abstractions
always leak</a>. (“You’re very clever, young man, but it’s reductionism
all the way down!”) This is in some sense the opposite of a
mathematician: a mathematician tries to ‘see through’ a complex system’s
accidental complexity up to a simpler more-abstract more-true version
which can be understood &amp; manipulated—but for the hacker, all
complexity is essential, and they are instead trying to</em> un<em>see
the simple abstract system down to the more-complex less-abstract (but
also more true) version. (A mathematician might try to transform a
program up into successively more abstract representations to eventually
show it is trivially correct; a hacker would prefer to compile a program
down into its most concrete representation to <a
href="/forking-path">brute force all execution paths</a> &amp; find an
exploit trivially proving it incorrect.</em> /// from Gwern’s excellent
<a href="https://gwern.net/unseeing">On Seeing Through and Unseeing: The
Hacker Mindset</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>At its core, (positivist) science develops abstractions which
attempt to regularize and explain the world. However, abstractions
always leak, and points of leakage point to two things:
<ol type="1">
<li>Leakage provides fodder and guidance on new scientific paradigms
<span class="citation"
data-cites="Kuhn_1996_StructureScientificRevolutions">(Kuhn
1996)</span>, which are spurred on by accumulated, unexplained anomalies
(e.g. Newtonian physics slightly misrepresents Mercury’s orbit).</li>
<li>Leakage allows <em>hackers</em> to <em>un</em>see the abstraction ,
to find novel uses of existing components. Hacking here can be hostile
or benign, but must include unintended uses as understood by the
designer(s).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Social science, more than the natural sciences, is plagued
by leakages across distinct areas of abstraction</strong>. Leaky
abstraction occurs across defining <em>both</em> cause (e.g. ego
depletion) and effect (e.g. task effort). More so than natural science,
social science also suffers from weak feedback mechanisms for when
theories do not bear out in the real world, <em>due to leakage</em>.
<ul>
<li>If a natural science concept is meant to predict a measurable
outcomes (e.g. mechanical engineering ensures a car’s brake works), it
is generally obvious when the brakes encounter a condition where they
fail. Because braking has very well defined, and generally low leakage
theoretical basis, identifying the causes of failure in a breaking
system requires identifying a <em>relative</em> manageable number of
possible failures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Leakage is multi-faceted and dynamic in social science,
exactly because the entities it applies to have a agency.</strong> Take
the example of social science operationalized into an ‘intervention’,
such as a village savings program meant to overcome poverty traps and
draw on social trust / embeddedness. It is far more difficult to isolate
the where the ‘leakage’ is occurring in the system when it fails. Why
might this be?
<ol type="1">
<li>Even a relatively simply village savings program will have
<em>very</em> different personalities in it between contexts.</li>
<li>Abstract categories such as gender, age, income, education, etc.,
which we can control for or directly manipulate via selection are thin
conceptions of much more complex socio-economic realities.</li>
<li>The <em>implementation</em> of the same model will vary dramatically
not only by organization, but within the same organization over
space</li>
<li>The category of a ‘village savings program’ has far too many degrees
of freedom to meaningfully ask what its effect is, <em>and these degrees
of design freedom are unspecified</em>.</li>
<li>Organizations <em>and communities</em> attempt to ‘hack’ the
abstract design of programs in both benign or hostile ways. They do this
by looking below the abstract rules, for how they can manipulate the
program for their own purposes.
<ul>
<li>An implementer may navigate degrees of freedom in pursuit of
<em>either/both</em> more impact (possibly increasing effort) or less
effort (possibly lowering impact). This depends on the implementer’s
intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Extrinsic motivation pushes towards
hacking institutional rules for less effort (even with lower impact) and
intrinsic for the opposite.</li>
<li>Communities seek to ‘hack’ program designs by nominally complying or
participating, while safeguarding groups’ interest or power. For
instance, measuring the attendance of a marginalized group (e.g. youth)
is an <em>abstraction</em> meant to capture empowerment and political
participation. However, communities may strictly control or monitor the
youth, to functionally render their attendance inert. Likewise, a
powerful leader may seek to have his/her children become informal or
formal leaders of these participatory spaces, capturing them while never
<em>directly</em> interfering.</li>
<li>Finally, <em>both</em> implementers and communities may see that the
rules are ‘held up’ by rules outside of the formal institution. They
don’t need to engage with the design at all. For instance, instead of
manipulating a rule, they may just bribe the implementer or government
(just as a burglar may ignore a triple-locked door and break a nearby
window).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implementing organizations and communities <em>learn</em> to ‘hack’
institutions more effectively over time. Fundamentally, the subjects of
natural science (even animals, for the most part) are unaware of the
laws which dictate their lives, and do not actively seek
<em>knowingly</em> to reinterpret them (taking evolutionary learning as
random walk exploration).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>We <em>want</em> program implementers to be ‘white-hat’
hackers</strong>, to understand both the abstract representation of
interventions, and to actively block routes for hostile hackers (whether
in communities or implementing bodies). Fundamentally, this relies on
two things:
<ol type="1">
<li>Building and maintaining the intrinsic motivation of mission-driven
implementers <span class="citation"
data-cites="Honig_2022_ManagingMotivationPublic">(Honig 2022)</span>,
and</li>
<li>Giving implementers a wide degrees of discretion to navigate by
judgement <span class="citation" data-cites="honig2018navigation">(Honig
2018)</span>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Social science may learn the exact wrong lesson without
addressing leakage.</strong> Perhaps most controversially, empirical
social science should promise far less in attempting to answer questions
where the abstract concepts are inherently leaky across <em>both</em>
the cause and effect measured (e.g. any paper which asks whether social
cohesion does X, or participatory budgeting does Y is fundamentally
asking an unanswerable question). <em>These papers are using a point (a
single combination of design elements), or even a set of points, to
attempt to describe an intrinsically non-ordered line (all possible
combinations)</em>.
<ul>
<li><strong>Rejecting all potential points on a line due to a point
being null is a fundamental class error.</strong> The theory may still
hold true, but a particular design did not work due to the many
different leakage possibilities. That <em>same</em> design may work
under different circumstances, or it may fail but in a different way.
Again, this is due to the immense agency of both implementers and
communities.</li>

<h3 id="reviewing-differentiation-cont.">Reviewing Differentiation
(cont.)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using natural log to remove exponents</strong>: because
<span class="math inline">\(ln(a^b)=b*ln(a)\)</span>, you can natural
log both sides of an equation to handle tricky exponents prior to
differentiation (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(x^{ln(x)}\)</span>).
<ul>
<li><strong>General log differentiation</strong>: <span
class="math inline">\(\dfrac{d}{dx}​log_b​(u(x))=\dfrac{u&#39;(x)}{ln(b)u(x)}​\)</span><br />
</li>
<li><strong>Natural log differentiation</strong>: <span
class="math inline">\(\dfrac{d}{dx}\ln(u(x))=\dfrac{u&#39;(x)}{u(x)}\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implicit-differentiation">Implicit differentiation</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Implicit differentiation is typically used when variables cannot
be expressed as a function of one another, but there is a relationship
via an equation (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(x^2+y^2=1\)</span>).
Typically, this requires the chain rule to solve without isolating one
variable and substituting. ### Acceleration + velocity</p></li>
<li><p>Velocity is the first derivative of position, while acceleration
is the second.</p>
<ul>
<li>Velocity <span class="math inline">\((v)\)</span> is the derivative
of position <span class="math inline">\((s)\)</span> with respect to
time <span class="math inline">\((t)\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[v(t) = \frac{ds}{dt}\]</span></li>
<li>Acceleration <span class="math inline">\((a)\)</span> is the
derivative of velocity (so <span
class="math inline">\(d^2s/dt^2\)</span>): <span
class="math display">\[a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} =
\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}\]</span></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linear-approximation">Linear approximation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Approximating the tangent line is given by adding the output of the
function to the <em>product</em> of the derivative at that point plus
the distance between x (the new point) and (the independent variable at
point of tangency). <span class="math display">\[L(x) = h(a) +
h&#39;(a)(x-a)\]</span></li>
