agency</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Altruism, Ethnicity, Nationalism – and collective
action</strong>
<ul>
<li>How does <em>doing</em> collective action effect group identities
and foster altruistic collective action (cyclically)?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>When does recognizing ethnicity decrease or inflame violence
in plural societies?</strong> Diversity Violence and Recognition –
Elizabeth King and Samii, <span class="citation" data-cites="King_2020_DiversityViolenceRecognition">(King and Samii
2020)</span>)
<ul>
<li>King and Samii are present a theory and study on recognition of
ethnic identities within <em>formal institutions</em>. The incorporation
of identity is termed the ‘recognition regime’, versus non-recognition
regime. The type of recognition within these can be thick (accompanied
by diverse and rich benefits) or thin (merely symbolic).</li>
<li>Non-recognition include <em>laïcité</em> in France and/or banning of
explicitly ethnic parties, such as in Turkey. Explicit ethnic
power-sharing, such as in Burundi or Switzerland.
<ul>
<li><em>Note: The Design Space</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Nadel_2016_SearchingDevilDetails">(Nadel and Pritchett
2016)</span> <em>for these policy designs is high dimensional. This
presents a challenge for theories and empirics.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>These regimes not only incorporate ethnic identities, but also shape
them through categorization and institutions implemented, made
(more/less) legible, and potentially reinforced by the state.</li>
<li>Liberal and modernization theory supposes identities should become
less salient for conflict with development. However, there is a puzzle
in which ethnic identities, and often intertwined nationalistic
identities (see Benedict Anderson’s Imagined Communities), have become
only drivers of conflict (citing <span class="citation" data-cites="horowitz2000ethnic">(Horowitz 1985)</span>).</li>
<li>Political entrepreneurs often <em>use</em> ethnic cleavages to drive
conflict. In these cases, the use of ethnic conflict <em>hardens</em>
ethnic cleavages (“it is often conflict itself that further shapes and
hardens group identities”).</li>
<li>King and Samii point out a few starting premises causal mechanics
with opposite intuitions for how recognition effects violence:
<ol type="1">
<li><em>mobilization</em> effects of recognition mobilize people around
ethnicity in political competition (which can become violent conflict).
In this case, this hardens the alignment of political competition on
ethnic lines.</li>
<li><em>assurance</em> effects of recognition show the acceptance of
plural ethnicity in a nation. Especially adopting recognition
institutions meant to promote equity, can <em>ameliorate</em> ethnic
violence by decreasing grievances.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>King and Samii’s solution is that the ‘leadership regime’ is
positioned differently across contexts vis-a-vis the recognition regime.
<ul>
<li>If leaders are from an ethnic plurality, then it is both politically
safer to adopt a recognition regime and more effective at reducing
conflict (both mechanisms work in their favor). This is because the
mobilization effect or recognition benefits them due to a larger
population to mobilize</li>
<li>But, if leaders are from an ethnic minority, these two mechanisms
class (mobilization works against them, while assurance works for them)
it is politically riskier and potentially less effective. The
mobilization effect draws on the smaller percentage of their co-ethnics,
thus benefiting other aspiring political leaders (of the larger
ethnicity(ies))
<ul>
<li>The reason recognition doesn’t work for minority leaders is
second-order. <em>Due to the negative mobilizatio effect</em>, they are
likely to take counter-measures to avoid losing power (relative to
before the recognition regime).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Their cross-national regressions support this (60% of post-conflict
constitutions for majority-led governments vs. 24 for minority-led
include recognition regimes).</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Self Efficacy extends but does not contradict rational
choice theory</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Self-efficacy is <em>an individual’s belief in his or her capacity
to execute behaviors necessary to produce specific performance
attainments</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Bandura_1997_SelfEfficacyExercise">(Bandura
1997)</span></li>
<li>Self-efficacy does not necessary dispute rationalist theories, as it
can be seen as a coefficient on the expected value. If we believe our
actions are successful with a lower probability, we are less likely to
initiate them.</li>
<li>This is a <em>mediating step</em> in rationalist calculations. Not
only do we need to calculate the expected payoffs of different actions,
we also need to incorporate our likelihood of <em>successfully achieving
those actions conditional on deciding to attempt them</em>. Our
efficiacy is a function of our capacity in a certain domain and under
certain conditions. ( <span class="math inline">\(\text{efficacy} =
P(\text{success | attempt})\)</span>). This <span class="math inline">\(\text{efficacy} =  f(\text{percieved capacity to
complete X task})\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Agency and democracy</strong>: What does it mean to have
agency? My intuition is that agency is core to democracy. Both as an
outcome (democracies should safeguard agency), but also as an input:
agency (the ability to take political <em>action</em> as Arendt would
say) at a group level is a core characteristic of democracy.</li>
<li>This is a variation of the argument that democracy is the capacity
to collective problem solve, as in Warren’s Problem-based conception of
democracy’ <span class="citation" data-cites="Warren_2017_ProblemBasedApproachDemocratic">(Warren
2017)</span>. There are a few</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/feedback-is-all-you-need">Feedback
is all you need… for agency to emerge</a></strong>: Gordon from squishy
computer discusses agency as a spectrum, specifically the breadth of
action one is able to take in response to feedback (this is in reference
to AI systems). He argues that a thermostat is a (very limited) agent.
The ability to update based on goal orientation.</li>
<li><ul>
<li><strong>Agency as a strategic game</strong>: <a href="https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/how-to-be-more-agentic">Cate
Hall</a> discusses it as a strategy and approach to life
(e.g. increasing surface area for luck, and seeking feedback), but does
not delve into the term directly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Agency as Freedom</strong> Amartya Sen discusses agency as
Freedom. I believe he means freedom to both make and pursue goals.
However, I am unaware of whether he discusses where people get a sense
of agency <em>from</em>. Arguably, there is an innate motivating engine
towards creating. <em>Action</em>, as Arendt may call it in Human
Condition_Arendt|The Human Condition. This force is political in her
telling, but it is also the notion that impulse to take action outside
of oneself.</li>
<li><strong>Goal vs. Action Agency, and understanding</strong>: The
literature on agency seems to fail to differentiate between Goal Agency
and Action Agency. Deterministic systems, by definition, have no goal
agency. My first impulse is that this is at least <em>heuristically</em>
true even if you introduce stochasticity into a deterministic system.
LLMs are excellent examples of entities which seem to have agency due to
stochasticity.
<ul>
<li><strong>Agency and AI</strong>: However, there is a (largely
philosophical) debate about whether LLMs actually <em>understand</em>
concepts, and therefore can meaningfully generate goals, or if they are
‘stochastic parrots’ which mimic (but do not have) human goal setting.
These may not be distinguishable at the limit (as Altman famously
quipped, we may be stochastic parrots “<a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599471830255177728?lang=en">i am
[note: maybe] a stochastic parrot, and so [note: maybe] r u”</a>’). The
distinction likely comes down to experiences of consciousness, and
whether you need to <em>experience</em> understanding (computers
couldn’t provably do) or simply show symptoms of it (computers have
provably done, espcially with LLms). Of course, there are many kinds of
understanding, such as tacit, explicit, feeling of, etc.. We cannot
prove that computers <em>experience</em> any of these without
consciousness.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Goals require an implicit questions, which LLMs cannot
ask</strong>: All goals are responses to the question of ‘what should be
done to solve… X’. This is often implicit, but this ability to ask and
<em>select between</em> ‘answers’ to a question is a fundamental aspect
of agency. In this, many agents which has action agency, do not have
goal agency, because they cannot select their own questions. For
instance, a thermostat has responsiveness (action agency). But it cannot
ask what a good temperature for a house <em>would be</em>. Because this
requires answering positing the question “how <em>should</em> the house
feel?”. Both asking <em>and</em> answering this question are core to
agency. Asking the question supposes that the answer is meaningful to
something. That something is the agent (the proposer). But, critically,
selecting between multiple answers to the question is the second half of
what agency is. Because, there is no ‘correct’ answer without reference
to an agent. To go back to the example of the thermostat, a human agent
decides they want the temperature either extremely cold to keep meat
frozen, or even colder to carry out a plasma experiment. Alternately,
for tropical plants, a thermostat may be tasked to keep a room at a
balmy &gt; 25°C. This goes back to determinism. If an agent is entirely
deterministic, then it has no agency, even if it <em>seems</em> to have
agency due to a large and ‘black box’ process for generating and
selecting between options. At its limit, we cannot prove that humans
have agency. However, we perceive them as having agency because we could
never predict all human action mechanistically.</li>
<li><strong>Other</strong>:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh-keys"><strong>SSH
Keys</strong></a>
<ul>
<li>These are cryptographic keys but functionally passwords meant to
stop ‘man in the middle’ attacks.</li>
<li>Establishing an SSH key for my github locally means I do not have to
enter my credentials as often from the CLI.</li>
<li>These are stored in an .ssh directory, typically in the ‘home’
folder.</li>
<li>These have associated passphrases (which are shorter, user generated
passwords) which further verify the use.</li>
<li>The <em>private</em> ‘identity key’ is a very long key stored in
./.ssh/ssh_id_rsa. RSA stands for
“<strong>Rivest-Shamir-Adleman</strong> cryptosystem”. RSA is based on
the computing difficulty of factoring very large integers.</li>
<li>The <em>public</em> key is stored in .ssh/id_rsa.pub. This is used
to authenticate the private key.</li>
<li>Finally, ‘known hosts’ can be put in the ‘known_hosts’ file under
./.ssh/known_hosts. Known hosts stores the keys of servers you’ve
connected to in the past. For instance, I can add github’s to my
known_host file and it will not prompt me to verify github’s RSA
‘fingerprint’. The fingerprint is a hash of github’s full public RSA
(i.e. much shorter). e.g. github’s fingerprint is:
SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
<ul>
<li>NB: Hashes are algorithmically generated versions of data. These are
irreversible and small changes in the original will change the hash.
They, therefore, can represent a unique version of data which is
unperturbed. The same algorithm run agains the data, if tampered with,
would produce a verifiably different hash</li>
