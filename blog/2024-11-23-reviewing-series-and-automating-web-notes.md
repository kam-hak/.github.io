# Reviewing Series and Automating Web-notes

- **Maths**
	- Binomial theorem: $(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k$, note that $\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$ is the binomial selection of n from k. 
	- Arithmetic sums solves as: $S_n = \frac{n}{2}*(a+l)$, where a is first term, l is last term, and n is the number of terms
		- Sigma notation: $S_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \left( a_1 + (k-1)d \right)$ -- here d is the amount of de/in-crementation
	- Geometric sum solves as: $S_n=a*\frac{1-(r)^n}{1-r}$, where $r$ is the ratio of interest and $a$ is the first time
		- Sigma notation: $S = \sum_{n=0}^{24} a \cdot (r)^n$
- **Setting up personal blog/website**
	- I've set up a blog page for my website (kamranhakiman.com/blog), and improved the readability of the very simple website (e.g. limited the width of text to wrap at 800px). I'm doing coding by hand for muscle memory learning. 
	- Next, I want to learn how to automatically export from a folder with simple markdown docs.
